# Cat Attack!
Cat Attack is a 1v1, two player fighting game in which players duel in a 2D environment. 

Written completely in Java, **Cat Attack!** is a game still under development. Build as apart of the AP Computer Science Game Collaboration Project, this game was an original idea proposed by group members highly inspired by Street Fighter. 
As it is still in the works, the game may be rough around the edges, with any branch other than main not guaranteed to be functional. 

In addition, [Working Function](https://github.com/EmperorMurfy/Cat_Attack/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-working-features) + [Future Proposed Functions](https://github.com/EmperorMurfy/Cat_Attack/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-working-features) may be out of date, please check the latest release for more up to date info. 

Note: Main is the main release repository, should be the most stable version - suggested to use the files from release for most stable. 
Please check the latest release for work in progress/buggy functions
